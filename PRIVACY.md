Last updated: 2026-02-08

Mafia (“the Bot”, “we”, “our”) respects your privacy.  
This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and your rights.

## 1. Scope

This policy applies to the Mafia Discord bot and related services used to operate gameplay features.

## 2. Data We Collect

We may process the following categories of data:

- Discord user identifiers
  - User ID
  - Username/display name (when needed for gameplay display)
- Discord server identifiers
  - Guild ID
  - Channel ID (for certain bot features)
- Gameplay data
  - In-game currency, levels, XP, inventory, weapons, team setup, quest progress, cooldowns, streaks, and similar progression records

- Technical/operational data
  - Basic error logs and diagnostic events required to maintain service stability

We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data categories.

## 3. How We Collect Data

Data is collected when:

- You use bot commands
- You interact with bot components (buttons, menus, etc.)
- The bot needs to store gameplay progression or anti-abuse state
- Server administrators configure bot settings

## 4. Why We Use Data

We process data to:

- Provide core gameplay functionality
- Save progression and economy state
- Prevent abuse, cheating, exploitation, or service disruption
- Enforce fair-play and moderation mechanisms
- Maintain, debug, and improve service reliability

## 5. Legal Basis (General)

Where applicable, processing is based on:

- Legitimate interests (service operation, abuse prevention, stability)
- Necessity for providing requested service features (gameplay functions)
- Consent where required by law or platform policy

## 6. Data Sharing

We do not sell personal data.  
We do not share user data with third parties for advertising.

Data may be disclosed only when necessary:

- To comply with legal obligations
- To protect the security and integrity of the service
- To enforce Terms of Service and anti-abuse actions

## 7. Data Retention

We retain data as long as reasonably necessary for:

- Gameplay continuity
- Fraud/abuse prevention
- Operational and legal obligations

We may remove, anonymize, or reset stored data at our discretion for balancing, maintenance, or compliance reasons.

## 8. Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect stored data.  
However, no system is 100% secure, and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## 9. International Processing

Data may be processed in different jurisdictions depending on infrastructure and platform services.  
By using the Bot, you acknowledge this possibility.

## 10. Children’s Privacy

The Bot is intended for users who meet Discord’s minimum age requirements and applicable local legal age standards.  
We do not knowingly collect data from children below legal platform age.

## 11. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may request:

- Access to your stored data
- Correction of inaccurate data
- Deletion of data (where applicable)
- Restriction or objection to certain processing

To make a request, contact the development team through official support channels.

## 12. Data Deletion Requests

If you want your gameplay data removed:

1. Contact support with your Discord User ID.
2. Provide proof of account ownership.
3. We will review and process eligible requests within a reasonable timeframe.

Some records may be retained where legally required or necessary for abuse prevention.

## 13. Third-Party Services

The Bot operates on Discord and may rely on hosting/infrastructure providers.  
Their own privacy policies and terms may also apply.

## 14. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
Material changes may be announced through official channels (e.g., patch notes/announcement channels).  
Continued use of the Bot after updates means acceptance of the revised policy.
